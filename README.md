# simple-django-web
My first django web and a simple django blog! with some features ! ( Not very simple :\ )

Download the project. Then open the source code directory and paste .env-sample to .env !

Next go to the project directory in the terminal and type:

1.pip install virtualenv

2.virtualenv env

3."env/Scripts/activate.bat"

4.pip install -r requirements.txt

5.python manage.py compilemessages

6.python manage.py runserver


Note:

Unfortunately, the folder names of this project are not correct and related!

Because this project was not previously a django blog project and later became it, and for some reason we could not change the names.

Consider myportfolio folder as config and portfolio folder as django-blog. thanks!


Done ! Enjoy !
